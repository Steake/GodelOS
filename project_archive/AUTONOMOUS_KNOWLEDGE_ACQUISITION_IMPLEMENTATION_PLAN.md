# GödelOS Autonomous Knowledge Acquisition & Stream of Consciousness Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the GödelOS system with autonomous knowledge acquisition capabilities and real-time stream of consciousness visibility. The system will be able to independently collect and direct its own knowledge gathering processes, trigger knowledge acquisition when questions are asked, and provide real-time visibility into the system's cognitive processes.

## Architecture Summary

The implementation extends the existing metacognition system by enhancing the `MetacognitionManager` and `SelfMonitoringModule` with new autonomous capabilities:

- **Autonomous Knowledge Acquisition**: System can detect knowledge gaps and autonomously gather missing information
- **Real-time Cognitive Streaming**: Users can see the system's "thoughts" in real time through WebSocket connections
