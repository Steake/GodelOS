  "response": "Based on my knowledge: Expert surveys suggest a 50% probability of artificial general intelligence (AGI) by 2045, with high uncertainty. Estimates for AGI emergence before 2030 range from 10-25%. Key factors include computational scaling, algorithmic breakthroughs, and theoretical advances in consciousness and intelligence. The probability remains uncertain due to fundamental unknowns in AI development.",
