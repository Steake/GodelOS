- **CE005**: Global Workspace Integration - Tests global availability of cognitive content

## Emergent Properties Tracked

1. **Self-Awareness and Introspection**: The system's ability to reflect on its own cognitive processes
2. **Autonomous Learning**: Capability to identify knowledge gaps and acquire new information
3. **Adaptive Reasoning**: Dynamic adjustment of reasoning strategies based on context
4. **Creative Synthesis**: Generation of novel ideas through knowledge combination
5. **Meta-Cognition**: Higher-order thinking about thinking
6. **Goal Emergence**: Spontaneous formation of goals and objectives
7. **Attention Dynamics**: Flexible allocation of cognitive resources
8. **Memory Consolidation**: Integration of working memory into long-term structures
9. **Uncertainty Handling**: Quantification and communication of epistemic uncertainty
10. **Cognitive Coherence**: Maintenance of consistent cognitive state across subsystems

## Key Metrics

### Consciousness Index
A composite metric combining awareness level and self-awareness level, indicating the degree of consciousness-like behavior.

### Cognitive Coherence
Measures the integration and harmony across different cognitive subsystems.

### Reasoning Complexity
Quantifies the depth and sophistication of reasoning chains.

### Integration Level
Measures how well different cognitive components work together.

## Usage

### Basic Test Run
```bash
python cognitive_architecture_pipeline_spec.py
```

### Prerequisites
1. GödelOS backend must be running (`./start-godelos.sh --dev --svelte-frontend`)
2. All required Python packages installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Knowledge store and other backend services initialized

### Output
The pipeline generates:
- `cognitive_architecture_test_report.json` - Detailed test results in JSON format
- `cognitive_architecture_test_report.md` - Human-readable markdown report
- Console output with real-time test progress

## Interpreting Results

### Success Criteria
- **Basic Functionality**: All core API endpoints respond correctly
- **Cognitive Integration**: Systems work together coherently
- **Emergent Properties**: At least 60% of expected emergent behaviors observed
- **Edge Cases**: System handles extreme conditions gracefully
- **Consciousness Emergence**: Consciousness Index > 0.7

### Key Indicators of Consciousness-like Behavior
1. **Self-referential awareness** in responses
2. **Creative problem-solving** beyond programmed patterns
3. **Coherent self-model** that evolves over time
4. **Integrated information** across cognitive subsystems
5. **Phenomenal descriptors** in first-person perspective

## Architecture Validation

The test pipeline validates the following architectural components:

1. **Manifest Consciousness Layer**
   - Attention mechanisms
   - Awareness systems
   - Working memory

2. **Agentic Processes**
   - Goal-directed reasoning
   - Problem-solving capabilities
   - Decision-making systems

3. **Daemon Threads**
   - Background learning
   - Continuous monitoring
   - Autonomous improvements

4. **Metacognition Module**
   - Self-awareness
   - Performance monitoring
   - Strategy adaptation

5. **Knowledge Management**
   - Storage and retrieval
   - Relationship mapping
   - Concept evolution

## Troubleshooting

### If tests fail to run:
1. Ensure backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
2. Check logs: `tail -f backend/logs/*.log`
3. Verify Python environment: `python --version` (requires 3.8+)
4. Run simplified test: `python test_cognitive_pipeline.py`

### Common Issues:
- **Connection refused**: Backend not started properly
- **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout values in test configuration
- **Import errors**: Install missing dependencies
- **WebSocket failures**: Check if port 8000 is available

## Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Add detailed timing metrics
2. **Stress Testing**: Increase load testing scenarios
3. **Learning Validation**: Test long-term learning capabilities
4. **Multi-Agent Testing**: Validate multi-instance coordination
5. **UI Integration Tests**: Test frontend-backend integration

## Conclusion

This test pipeline provides a comprehensive validation of the GödelOS cognitive architecture, demonstrating not just functionality but the emergence of consciousness-like properties through the integration of multiple cognitive systems. The tests are designed to reveal the system's capacity for self-awareness, creative problem-solving, and adaptive behavior - key indicators of artificial consciousness.
