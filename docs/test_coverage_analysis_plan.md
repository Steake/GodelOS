# Test Coverage Analysis Plan for GödelOS

## 1. Overview of Current Test Structure

The GödelOS project has a well-organized test structure that mirrors the module structure of the source code. Tests are categorized into logical groups such as core_kr, inference, learning, common_sense, metacognition, etc. The project includes both unit tests for individual components and integration tests for testing interactions between components.

    B --> D[Core KR Tests]
    B --> E[Inference Engine Tests]
    B --> F[Learning System Tests]
    B --> G[Metacognition Tests]
    B --> H[Common Sense Tests]
    B --> I[NLU/NLG Tests]
    B --> J[Ontology Tests]
    B --> K[Scalability Tests]
    B --> L[Symbol Grounding Tests]
    C --> M[Module Integration Tests]
    C --> N[System Integration Tests]
```

## 2. Analysis Methodology

The following approach will be used to analyze test coverage:

1. **Component Mapping**: Create a comprehensive map of all source components and their corresponding test files
2. **Coverage Assessment**: For each component, assess:
   - Existence of basic unit tests
   - Functionality coverage (which methods/features are tested)
   - Edge case coverage
   - Error handling coverage
   - Integration test coverage
3. **Gap Identification**: Identify components with:
   - No tests
   - Minimal tests
   - Missing test types (unit, integration, etc.)
   - Untested critical functionality
4. **Priority Assignment**: Assign priorities to identified gaps based on:
   - Component criticality to system functionality
   - Complexity of untested code
   - Potential impact of failures

## 3. Detailed Analysis Steps

### 3.1 Component Mapping

```mermaid

    A[List all source files] --> B[Identify corresponding test files]
    B --> C[Create component-test mapping]
    C --> D[Identify components without tests]
```

1. Generate a complete list of source files in the project
2. For each source file, identify corresponding test files
3. Create a mapping between components and their tests
4. Identify components that lack corresponding test files

### 3.2 Coverage Assessment for Inference Engine

```mermaid

    A[Analyze Inference Engine Components] --> B[base_prover.py]
    A --> C[coordinator.py]
    A --> D[proof_object.py]
    A --> E[resolution_prover.py]
    A --> F[modal_tableau_prover.py]
    A --> G[clp_module.py]
    A --> H[smt_interface.py]
    A --> I[analogical_reasoning_engine.py]
    
    B --> J[Assess test coverage]
    C --> J
    D --> J
    E --> J
    F --> J
    G --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J
    
    J --> K[Document findings]
```

For each component:
1. Review source code to identify key functionality
2. Examine corresponding test files
3. Assess which methods and features are tested
4. Identify untested functionality
5. Evaluate edge case and error handling coverage
6. Document findings in a structured format

### 3.3 Coverage Assessment for Metacognition

```mermaid

    A[Analyze Metacognition Components] --> B[meta_knowledge.py]
    A --> C[diagnostician.py]
    A --> D[manager.py]
    A --> E[modification_planner.py]
    A --> F[module_library.py]
    A --> G[self_monitoring.py]
    
    B --> H[Assess test coverage]
    C --> H
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H
    
    H --> I[Document findings]
```

For each component:
1. Review source code to identify key functionality
2. Examine corresponding test files
3. Assess which methods and features are tested
4. Identify untested functionality
5. Evaluate edge case and error handling coverage
6. Document findings in a structured format

### 3.4 Integration Test Analysis

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Analyze Integration Tests] --> B[Identify covered component interactions]
    B --> C[Map integration test coverage]
    C --> D[Identify untested interactions]
    D --> E[Document findings]
```

1. Review all integration test files
2. Identify which component interactions are tested
3. Create a map of integration test coverage
4. Identify critical component interactions that lack tests
5. Document findings in a structured format

### 3.5 Gap Identification and Prioritization

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Compile findings from all analyses] --> B[Identify components with no tests]
    A --> C[Identify components with minimal tests]
    A --> D[Identify untested critical functionality]
    A --> E[Identify missing test types]
    
    B --> F[Assign priority based on component criticality]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    F --> G[Create prioritized gap list]
```

1. Compile findings from all previous analyses
2. Identify components with no tests
3. Identify components with minimal test coverage
4. Identify untested critical functionality
5. Identify missing test types (unit, integration, etc.)
6. Assign priorities based on component criticality and potential impact
7. Create a prioritized list of test coverage gaps

## 4. Deliverables

The analysis will produce the following deliverables:

1. **Component-Test Mapping**: A comprehensive mapping between source components and their corresponding test files
2. **Coverage Assessment**: Detailed assessment of test coverage for each component
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identification of components with insufficient test coverage
4. **Prioritized Recommendations**: A prioritized list of recommendations for improving test coverage
5. **Test Coverage Report**: A comprehensive report summarizing the findings and recommendations
