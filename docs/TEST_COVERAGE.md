## Guidelines for Writing New Tests

To maintain consistency and quality in the test suite, follow these guidelines when writing new tests for GödelOS components.

### Test File Naming Conventions

- **Unit Tests**: Name test files as `test_<component_name>.py`
  - Example: `test_meta_knowledge.py` for testing the `meta_knowledge.py` module
  
- **Enhanced Tests**: Name test files as `test_<component_name>_enhanced.py`
  - Example: `test_meta_knowledge_enhanced.py` for enhanced tests of the `meta_knowledge.py` module
  
- **Integration Tests**: Name test files as `test_integration.py` within the appropriate module directory
  - Example: `tests/metacognition/test_integration.py` for metacognition integration tests

### Test Class and Method Naming Conventions

- **Test Classes**: Name test classes as `Test<ComponentName>` or `Test<ComponentName>Enhanced`
  - Example: `TestMetaKnowledge` or `TestMetaKnowledgeEnhanced`
  
- **Test Methods**: Name test methods as `test_<functionality_being_tested>`
  - Example: `test_initialize_meta_knowledge` or `test_update_meta_knowledge_with_invalid_input`

### Test Structure and Organization

Each test file should follow this general structure:

```python
"""
Tests for the MetaKnowledge component.

This module contains tests for the MetaKnowledge class and related functionality.
"""

import pytest
from godelOS.metacognition.meta_knowledge import MetaKnowledge, MetaKnowledgeStore

# Test fixtures
@pytest.fixture
def meta_knowledge_instance():
    """Create a MetaKnowledge instance for testing."""
    return MetaKnowledge()

@pytest.fixture
def populated_meta_knowledge():
    """Create a MetaKnowledge instance with pre-populated data."""
    mk = MetaKnowledge()
    # Add test data
    return mk

# Test classes
class TestMetaKnowledge:
    """Tests for the MetaKnowledge class."""
    
    def test_initialization(self, meta_knowledge_instance):
        """Test that MetaKnowledge initializes correctly."""
        assert meta_knowledge_instance is not None
        # More assertions...
    
    def test_add_meta_knowledge(self, meta_knowledge_instance):
        """Test adding meta-knowledge to the store."""
        # Test code...
        
    # More test methods...

class TestMetaKnowledgeStore:
    """Tests for the MetaKnowledgeStore class."""
    
    # Test methods...
```

### Using pytest Fixtures and Markers

Fixtures provide a way to set up test dependencies:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def inference_engine():
    """Create an inference engine for testing."""
    from godelOS.inference_engine.coordinator import InferenceCoordinator
    return InferenceCoordinator()

@pytest.fixture
def knowledge_store():
    """Create a knowledge store for testing."""
    from godelOS.core_kr.knowledge_store.interface import KnowledgeStoreInterface
    return KnowledgeStoreInterface()

def test_inference_with_knowledge(inference_engine, knowledge_store):
    """Test inference using a knowledge store."""
    # Test code using both fixtures
```

Use markers to categorize tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_complex_inference():
    """A slow test that performs complex inference."""
    # Test code...

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_metacognition_inference_integration():
    """Test integration between metacognition and inference."""
    # Test code...
```

### Writing Effective Assertions

Write clear, specific assertions:

```python
def test_meta_knowledge_retrieval(populated_meta_knowledge):
    """Test retrieving meta-knowledge."""
    # Arrange
    key = "reasoning_capability"
    expected_value = {"name": "resolution", "performance": 0.85}
    
    # Act
    actual_value = populated_meta_knowledge.get(key)
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_value is not None, f"Meta-knowledge for {key} should exist"
    assert actual_value["name"] == expected_value["name"], "Name should match"
    assert actual_value["performance"] == pytest.approx(expected_value["performance"]), "Performance should be approximately equal"
```

### Handling Test Dependencies

When tests have dependencies on other components, use mocking or stubbing:

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

def test_metacognition_manager_with_mocked_diagnostician():
    """Test MetacognitionManager with a mocked Diagnostician."""
    # Create a mock Diagnostician
    mock_diagnostician = MagicMock()
    mock_diagnostician.diagnose_reasoning_error.return_value = {
        "error_type": "logical_fallacy",
        "description": "Affirming the consequent",
        "severity": "high"
    }
    
    # Create the MetacognitionManager with the mock
    from godelOS.metacognition.manager import MetacognitionManager
    manager = MetacognitionManager(diagnostician=mock_diagnostician)
    
    # Test the manager's behavior with the mock
    result = manager.handle_reasoning_error("some_error_data")
    
    # Assert that the mock was called correctly
    mock_diagnostician.diagnose_reasoning_error.assert_called_once_with("some_error_data")
    
    # Assert on the result
    assert result["error_type"] == "logical_fallacy"
```

### Mocking and Stubbing Techniques

Use `unittest.mock` for mocking:

```python
# Mocking a method
with patch.object(MetaKnowledge, 'update', return_value=True) as mock_update:
    result = meta_knowledge_instance.process_update(data)
    mock_update.assert_called_once_with(data)
    assert result is True

# Mocking a module
with patch('godelOS.inference_engine.smt_interface.Z3Solver') as MockZ3Solver:
    MockZ3Solver.return_value.solve.return_value = {"sat": True, "model": {"x": 5}}
    solver = SMTInterface()
    result = solver.solve_constraint("x > 0")
    assert result["sat"] is True
    assert result["model"]["x"] == 5
```

### Parameterized Tests

Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for testing multiple inputs:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_formula,expected_result", [
    ("A & B", True),
    ("A & ~A", False),
    ("A | ~A", True),
    ("(A => B) & A & ~B", False)
])
## Best Practices for Maintaining and Extending Test Coverage

Maintaining and extending test coverage is an ongoing process that requires discipline and attention. The following best practices will help ensure that the GödelOS test suite remains effective and comprehensive as the system evolves.

### Regular Test Coverage Analysis

Regularly analyze test coverage to identify gaps and areas for improvement:

1. **Scheduled Analysis**: Run the test coverage analysis tools on a regular schedule (e.g., weekly or after major changes).
2. **CI Integration**: Integrate test coverage analysis into the continuous integration pipeline.
3. **Coverage Thresholds**: Define minimum coverage thresholds for different modules and enforce them.
4. **Trend Monitoring**: Track coverage trends over time to ensure it doesn't decrease.

Example CI configuration for coverage analysis:

```yaml
# In CI configuration file
test_coverage:
  stage: test
  script:
    - ./run_test_coverage_analysis.sh
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - test_coverage_report.html
      - method_coverage_report.json
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
```

### Continuous Integration Considerations

Integrate testing into the development workflow:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run tests for modified files before allowing commits.
2. **Automated Test Runs**: Run the full test suite on every pull request.
3. **Test Result Visualization**: Display test results and coverage metrics in the CI dashboard.
4. **Blocking Failed Tests**: Block merges of code that fails tests or decreases coverage.

Example pre-commit hook configuration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-commit hook to run tests for modified files

# Get list of modified Python files
modified_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.py$')

if [ -n "$modified_files" ]; then
  echo "Running tests for modified files..."
  for file in $modified_files; do
    if [[ $file == godelOS/* ]]; then
      # Extract module name for test file lookup
      module_name=$(basename "$file" .py)
      test_file="tests/$(dirname "${file#godelOS/}")/test_$module_name.py"
      
      if [ -f "$test_file" ]; then
        echo "Running tests for $file"
        python -m pytest "$test_file" -v
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Tests failed for $file"
          exit 1
        fi
      fi
    fi
  done
fi

exit 0
```

### Updating Tests When Refactoring Code

When refactoring code, update tests accordingly:

1. **Test First**: Write or update tests before refactoring code.
2. **Preserve Behavior**: Ensure tests verify the same behavior before and after refactoring.
3. **Refactor Tests**: Refactor tests along with code to maintain readability and maintainability.
4. **Test Refactored Code**: Run tests after refactoring to ensure behavior hasn't changed.

Example workflow for refactoring with tests:

```
1. Write tests for the current behavior if they don't exist
2. Verify tests pass with the current implementation
3. Refactor the code
4. Run tests to ensure they still pass
5. Refactor the tests if necessary for clarity
```

### Balancing Test Coverage and Development Speed

Find the right balance between comprehensive testing and development speed:

1. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus more testing effort on critical or complex components.
2. **Test Automation**: Automate repetitive testing tasks to reduce manual effort.
3. **Test Categorization**: Categorize tests by importance and execution time.
4. **Fast Test Suites**: Optimize test suites to run quickly for developer feedback.
5. **Selective Testing**: Run only relevant tests during development.

Example test categorization:

```python
# Critical tests that must always pass
@pytest.mark.critical
def test_knowledge_consistency():
    # Test code...

# Slow tests that can be skipped during quick checks
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_large_scale_inference():
    # Test code...

# Run only fast tests during development
# pytest -m "not slow"

# Run all tests, including slow ones, in CI
# pytest
```

### Documentation Standards for Tests

Document tests thoroughly to make them understandable and maintainable:

1. **Test Purpose**: Clearly document what each test is verifying.
2. **Test Preconditions**: Document any required setup or preconditions.
3. **Expected Behavior**: Document the expected behavior being tested.
4. **Edge Cases**: Document any edge cases being tested.
5. **Test Data**: Document the test data and why it was chosen.

Example of well-documented test:

```python
def test_belief_revision_with_contradictory_information():
    """
    Test that the belief revision system correctly handles contradictory information.
    
    This test verifies that when new information contradicts existing beliefs,
    the system revises its beliefs according to the AGM belief revision principles,
    prioritizing more recent or more reliable information.
    
    The test uses a scenario where the system initially believes "All birds can fly",
    and then receives the contradictory information "Penguins are birds" and
    "Penguins cannot fly".
    
    Expected behavior:
    - The system should maintain consistency by revising its initial belief
    - The final belief set should entail "Most birds can fly" rather than "All birds can fly"
    - The belief "Penguins cannot fly" should be preserved
    """
    # Test code...
```

### Code Review Guidelines for Tests

Include tests in code reviews:

1. **Test Coverage**: Verify that new code is adequately tested.
2. **Test Quality**: Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of tests.
3. **Edge Cases**: Check that tests cover important edge cases.
4. **Test Readability**: Ensure tests are clear and maintainable.
5. **Test Independence**: Verify that tests are independent and don't interfere with each other.

Example code review checklist for tests:

```
Test Review Checklist:
- [ ] Tests cover all new functionality and code paths
- [ ] Tests include edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Tests are well-documented and easy to understand
- [ ] Tests are independent and don't rely on global state
- [ ] Tests run quickly and efficiently
- [ ] Tests use appropriate fixtures and mocking
```

### Test Maintenance Strategies

Keep tests maintainable over time:

1. **Test Refactoring**: Regularly refactor tests to improve clarity and efficiency.
2. **Remove Redundant Tests**: Eliminate tests that don't add value.
3. **Update Obsolete Tests**: Update tests that no longer reflect current requirements.
4. **Test for Regressions**: Add regression tests for fixed bugs.
5. **Test Data Management**: Manage test data carefully to avoid brittleness.

Example test maintenance workflow:

```
Quarterly Test Maintenance:
1. Run test coverage analysis
2. Identify tests with low value (e.g., duplicate coverage)
3. Identify tests that are slow or flaky
4. Refactor or remove problematic tests
5. Update test documentation
6. Verify that coverage remains adequate
```

## Performance Considerations

Performance is an important aspect of the testing infrastructure, especially as the codebase grows. The following considerations will help ensure that tests run efficiently and provide timely feedback.

### Optimizing Test Execution Time

Optimize tests to run quickly:

1. **Minimize Setup/Teardown**: Reduce the time spent on test setup and teardown.
2. **Efficient Assertions**: Use efficient assertions that fail fast.
3. **Appropriate Mocking**: Mock expensive dependencies to speed up tests.
4. **Resource Reuse**: Reuse resources across tests where appropriate.
5. **Test Size**: Keep individual tests focused and small.

Example of optimizing test setup:

```python
# Instead of creating a new instance for each test
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def type_system():
    """Create a type system once for all tests in the module."""
    return TypeSystemManager()

# Tests can now reuse the same type system
def test_type_inference(type_system):
    # Test code...

def test_type_checking(type_system):
    # Test code...
```

### Parallel Test Execution

Run tests in parallel to reduce overall execution time:

1. **Test Independence**: Ensure tests are independent and can run in parallel.
2. **Resource Isolation**: Isolate resources to prevent conflicts in parallel tests.
3. **Parallelization Strategy**: Choose an appropriate parallelization strategy (e.g., by module, by class).
4. **Worker Count**: Optimize the number of parallel workers based on available resources.

Example pytest configuration for parallel execution:

```ini
# In pytest.ini
[pytest]
addopts = -n auto
```

Example parallel test execution command:

```bash
# Run tests using 4 parallel workers
pytest -n 4
```

### Test Categorization for Selective Testing

Categorize tests to allow selective execution:

1. **Fast vs. Slow Tests**: Separate fast tests from slow tests.
2. **Unit vs. Integration Tests**: Separate unit tests from integration tests.
3. **Critical vs. Non-Critical Tests**: Identify critical tests that must always pass.
4. **Module-Specific Tests**: Organize tests by module for selective testing.

Example test selection commands:

```bash
# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run only tests for a specific module
pytest tests/metacognition/

# Run only critical tests
pytest -m "critical"

# Run only unit tests (not integration tests)
pytest -m "not integration"
```

### Caching Strategies

Use caching to avoid redundant work:

1. **Test Result Caching**: Cache test results to avoid rerunning unchanged tests.
2. **Fixture Caching**: Cache expensive fixtures.
3. **External Resource Caching**: Cache access to external resources.
4. **Dependency Caching**: Cache dependencies used in tests.

Example pytest configuration for caching:

```ini
# In pytest.ini
[pytest]
cache_dir = .pytest_cache
```

Example of using pytest's cache:

```python
def test_expensive_computation(request):
    # Try to get result from cache
    cache_key = "expensive_computation_result"
    result = request.config.cache.get(cache_key, None)
    
    if result is None:
        # Perform expensive computation
        result = perform_expensive_computation()
        # Store in cache for future tests
        request.config.cache.set(cache_key, result)
    
    # Use the result in the test
    assert result > 0
```

### Resource Management During Testing

Manage resources efficiently during testing:

1. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure resources are properly cleaned up after tests.
2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate limits on resource usage.
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor resource usage during test execution.
4. **Resource Isolation**: Isolate resources between tests to prevent interference.

Example of proper resource management:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def temp_database():
    """Create a temporary database for testing."""
    # Set up the resource
    db_path = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    db = Database(db_path)
    db.initialize()
    
    # Provide the resource to the test
    yield db
    
    # Clean up the resource
    db.close()
    shutil.rmtree(db_path)

def test_database_operations(temp_database):
    # Test code using the temporary database
    temp_database.add_record({"key": "value"})
    assert temp_database.get_record("key") == "value"
```

### Profiling and Monitoring Test Performance

Profile and monitor test performance:

1. **Test Timing**: Track and report test execution times.
2. **Performance Trends**: Monitor performance trends over time.
3. **Slow Test Identification**: Identify and optimize slow tests.
4. **Resource Usage Monitoring**: Monitor memory and CPU usage during tests.

Example of test profiling:

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def test_timer(request):
    """Time each test and report if it's too slow."""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    yield
    
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    if duration > 1.0:  # More than 1 second is considered slow
        print(f"\nSlow test: {request.node.name} took {duration:.2f} seconds")
        
        # Optionally log to a performance tracking system
        log_test_performance(request.node.name, duration)
```
def test_formula_evaluation(input_formula, expected_result):
    """Test evaluation of logical formulas."""
    from godelOS.inference_engine.resolution_prover import evaluate_formula
    result = evaluate_formula(input_formula)
    assert result == expected_result
```

### Edge Case Testing

Always include tests for edge cases:

```python
def test_empty_knowledge_store():
    """Test behavior with an empty knowledge store."""
    store = KnowledgeStoreInterface()
    assert store.get_all_statements() == []
    assert store.count() == 0

def test_very_large_knowledge_base():
    """Test performance with a very large knowledge base."""
    store = KnowledgeStoreInterface()
    # Add many statements
    for i in range(10000):
        store.add_statement(f"Statement_{i}")
    
    # Verify performance is acceptable
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    result = store.query("Statement_5000")
    end_time = time.time()
    
    assert end_time - start_time < 0.1, "Query should be fast even with large KB"
    assert result is not None
```

### Error Case Testing

Include tests for error cases:

```python
def test_invalid_formula_parsing():
    """Test that invalid formulas are handled correctly."""
    parser = FormalLogicParser()
    result, errors = parser.parse("(A & B")
    
    assert result is None
    assert len(errors) > 0
    assert "Unmatched parenthesis" in errors[0]

def test_type_error_handling():
    """Test that type errors are handled correctly."""
    type_system = TypeSystemManager()
    
    with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
        type_system.check_type("3", "Boolean")
    
    assert "Type mismatch" in str(excinfo.value)
```
  - Example: `test_query_optimization` ensures that queries are optimized for efficient execution.
  
- **Rule Compiler**: Tests for compiling logical rules into optimized execution plans.
  - Example: `test_rule_compilation` verifies that rules are compiled into efficient execution plans.
  
- **Parallel Inference**: Tests for distributing inference tasks across multiple processing units.
  - Example: `test_parallel_inference_speedup` checks that parallel inference provides speedup.
  
- **Caching System**: Tests for caching intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.
  - Example: `test_cache_hit_performance` ensures that cache hits improve performance.
  
- **Persistent KB**: Tests for managing efficient storage and retrieval of knowledge.
  - Example: `test_persistent_kb_retrieval` verifies that knowledge retrieval from persistent storage works correctly.
  
- **Scalability Manager**: Tests for coordinating all scalability components.
