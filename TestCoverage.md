Based on my analysis of the GödelOS project and its testing infrastructure, I've developed the following plan for creating the test coverage documentation. Does this meet your requirements?

# Detailed Plan for GödelOS Test Coverage Documentation

This plan outlines the structure and content for each of the three deliverables: TEST_COVERAGE.md, TEST_QUICKREF.md, and updates to README.md.

## Documentation Overview
