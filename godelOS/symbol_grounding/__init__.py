"""
Symbol Grounding System Module for GÃ¶delOS.

This module is responsible for connecting the agent's abstract symbolic representations
to data and interactions within a simulated environment. It bridges the gap between
symbolic knowledge and sensory-motor experience.

Components:
    - SimulatedEnvironment (Module 4.1): Maintains the state of a simulated world
    - PerceptualCategorizer (Module 4.2): Categorizes percepts into symbolic representations
    - ActionExecutor (Module 4.3): Executes actions in the environment
    - SymbolGroundingAssociator (Module 4.4): Associates symbols with percepts and actions
    - InternalStateMonitor (Module 4.5): Monitors the agent's internal state
