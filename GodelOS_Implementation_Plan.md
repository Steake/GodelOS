# GodelOS Architecture Update: Implementation Plan

## 1. Implementation Approach Overview

The implementation approach is designed for rapid deployment while maintaining backward compatibility with critical existing components, particularly the MetacognitionManager and KnowledgeStore. The plan follows a hybrid approach - extending existing components where possible while creating new modules where needed, with a feature-driven implementation priority.
